            <h2>The vibrance beauty of<i>  Italy, Europe</i></h2>
            <p>With its awe-inspiring art, architecture and culinary delights, <b><i>Italy</i></b> has been a star of the world stage for millennia. The epicenter of the Roman Empire and the birthplace of the Renaissance, this European virtuoso practically groans under the weight of its cultural cachet. The challenge for any visit to Italy is not so much where to go – an amazing experience is honestly assured wherever you end up – but rather how to go about it.</p>

            <h2>A place where ancient traditions fuse with modern life<i>  Japan, Asia</i></h2>
            <p><b><i>Japan</i></b> is truly <b><i>timeless</i></b>, it sparks all the senses, from its temple bells, capsule hotels and breezy cat islands to outdoor sculptures, pine-forest hot springs and umami flavors in world-class dining. With its myriad islands, towering mountains and megacities, <b><i>Japan</i></b> can be a daunting destination to get around. We've got everything you need to know.</p>
            <img src="./japan1.jpg" alt="" title="Hover Me">
            <p>The downside of having so many incredible attractions in one country is feeling overwhelmed by the options – where to even begin? <br> Don't worry – we're here to help with a round-up of the best things to do in <i>land of the rising sun</i>, both celebrated and under the radar.</p>

            <p><b><i>Japan</i></b> has a reputation as an etiquette-bound place that can be intimidating for first-time visitors. Booking accomodations at advance and arriving at the right can help you a lot. Top accommodations can book up weeks or even months in advance, so it's best to plan ahead.</p>
            <p>Particularly busy travel periods include the first week of January, cherry blossom season (late March through April, depending on the destination), “Golden Week” (April 29 to May 5) and August.</p>

            <h2>The land of the midnight sun<i>  Norway, Europe</i></h2>
            <p>The essence of <b><i>Norway</i></b>'s appeal is remarkably simple: this is one of the most beautiful countries on earth. <b><i>Norway</i></b> is renowned for its natural beauty, with its legion of fjords, glaciers and mountains demanding the attention of visitors. But, if you can pull your gaze away from the awe-inspiring landscape for just a few brief moments, you’ll also discover cutting-edge cultural venues, historic architecture and a quietly confident restaurant scene – characteristics that often fly under the radar when it comes to discussing Norway’s charms.</p>

                <p>Hi there, My name is Soumya and I created this blog to share my passion for travel and adventure.</p>
                <p>Our lives are time-starved and technology-driven and, let’s be honest, it’s not often that we actually take the necessary time to de-stress and truly switch off. Travel allows us to escape life’s daily demands, dramas and deadlines and enables us to clear our minds. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.</p>
                <p>This blog allows me to connect with like-minded travelers while documenting my own journey   around the globe. I hope my photos, tips and experiences will inspire you to explore new places and create memorable experiences. Thanks for joining me!</p>
